# voce

Description: voce is a minimal theme, suitable for text heavy articles. The front page features a list of recent posts spread over 2 columns. The category tabs allow readers to filter as per their interest, it is recommended to keep the number of categories low so it can fit into at most 2 lines. In line with minimalism, the theme does not support sidebars and widgets, allowing readers to concentrate fully on the article content. Although comments are supported, it is recommended to turn them off to preserve the clutter free look of the theme. Check out https://limbenjamin.com for a live preview.
